Enumerating elements of the Eisenstein array
==========

Literate Haskell module with functions to enumerate the elements of the Eisenstein array. 
Also, we provide a program that searches for occurrences of the Eisenstein array on OEIS. 
(Joint work with Roland Backhouse.)

In 1858, A.M. Stern published a detailed study of a process of constructing an infinite
sequence of numbers from a given pair of numbers.  Stern attributed
the process to Eisenstein, and the sequence of numbers is now known as
the Eisenstein array.

In a recent paper, we review Stern's paper and briefly
discuss algorithms that enumerate the elements of the Eisenstein
Array. In this document we present  several Haskell
implementations of these algorithms.
